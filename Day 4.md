Measured values:

- \(V_{IH} = 0.984 \, \text{V}\)  
- \(V_{OH} = 1.714 \, \text{V}\)  
- \(V_{IL} = 0.767 \, \text{V}\)  
- \(V_{OL} = 0.0976 \, \text{V}\)

Using these, the noise margins are:

- \(NM_L\) (Low noise margin) = 0.67  
- \(NM_H\) (High noise margin) = 0.73

## ðŸ§  Key Insights  
- The noise margins quantify how much noise the inverter can tolerate before flipping its logic state.  
- The values of \(NM_L\) and \(NM_H\) being relatively large (0.67 V and 0.73 V) indicate that the inverter is robust against voltage glitches.  
- This robustness is central to why CMOS technology is reliable for digital logic circuits even in the presence of noise.
