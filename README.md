# ðŸ§  CMOS Circuit Design and SPICE Simulations using Sky130

This repository contains my work from the **Workshop** on **CMOS Circuit Design and SPICE Simulations** using the **Sky130 PDK models**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

1. **Documentation(2).pdf**  
   A comprehensive report covering the key concepts and learnings from the workshop.  
   > ðŸ’¡ *Recommended:* Download and view this file locally, or open it via the GitHub **web interface** for proper rendering (not the mobile app).

2. **Day-wise Lab Work**  
   Each dayâ€™s experiment is organized in a separate folder, containing a detailed **`README.md`** with SPICE setups, plots, calculations, and observations.

 Structure:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Day1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day2.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day3.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day4.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day5.md
```

Ignore the cmos_workshop.pdf its damaged.
