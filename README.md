## 📂 Repository Structure

1. **Documentation(2).pdf**  
   A comprehensive report covering the key concepts and learnings from the workshop.  
   > 💡 *Recommended:* Download and view this file locally, or open it via the GitHub **web interface** for proper rendering (not the mobile app).

2. **Day-wise Lab Work**  
   Each day’s experiment is organized in a separate .md files, containing a detailed SPICE setups, plots, calculations, and observations.

 Structure:

```bash
├── Day1.md
├── Day2.md
