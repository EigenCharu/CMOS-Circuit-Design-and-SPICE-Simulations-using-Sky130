# Day 1 â€” Basic N-MOSFET Circuit Simulation using SPICE

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This experiment focuses on simulating the basic characteristics of an N-MOSFET using SPICE.  
The objective is to observe the Iâ€“V characteristics and analyze the transistor behavior at various gate voltages.

## ðŸ§  Observation
- The output characteristics show that I<sub>D</sub> increases with V<sub>GS</sub>, as expected.  
- The device transitions from the linear to the saturation region as V<sub>DS</sub> increases.  
- The SPICE results closely match theoretical predictions for an enhancement-type NMOS transistor.  
- The cutoff region occurs when V<sub>GS</sub> &lt; V<sub>T</sub>, where no conduction takes place.

## ðŸ§¾ Key Takeaways
- SPICE effectively models MOSFET behavior across different operating regions.  
- Increasing V<sub>GS</sub> enhances channel formation, leading to higher I<sub>D</sub>.  
- The results validate the quadratic relationship between I<sub>D</sub> and V<sub>GS</sub> in long-channel NMOS devices.
