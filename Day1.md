# Day 1 â€” Basic N-MOSFET Circuit Simulation using SPICE

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This experiment focuses on simulating the basic characteristics of an N-MOSFET using SPICE.  
The objective is to observe the Iâ€“V characteristics and analyze the transistor behavior at various gate voltages.

### Drain Current at \( V_{DS} = 1.3\,V \)
The drain current (\( I_D \)) corresponding to \( V_{DS} = 1.3\,V \) is shown below:

## ðŸ§  Observation
- The output characteristics show that \( I_D \) increases with \( V_{GS} \), as expected.  
- The device transitions from linear to saturation region as \( V_{DS} \) increases.  
- The SPICE results closely match theoretical predictions for an enhancement-type NMOS transistor.
